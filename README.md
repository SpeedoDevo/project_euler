# Project Euler

My solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems, in Rust. Writes unit tests automatically, without revealing solutions (thanks to [projecteuler-solutions](https://github.com/luckytoilet/projecteuler-solutions)). Has a fancy GTK app to submit solutions quickly.

Code reviews are more than welcome!
